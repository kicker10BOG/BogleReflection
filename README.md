# BogleReflection
Eclipse project with classes that provide reflection for Java programs

The provided classes can be used for exploring and mapping out any class loaded by the JVM. 

Currently it only maps out the class with its fields and methods. Interfaces and nested classes are to ne added. 

See the test files for examples on how to use it. 

Requires Java 1.8, but can be easily modified to support older versions.
